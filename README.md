# AngularPhotoAlbum

Please build this using Angular. Please limit yourself to 1-1.5 hours. Don't worry about completing it all, the goal is more to get an idea of your coding and thinking style.
Create a web application that allows for displaying photo albums for multiple users using the data located at the /users, /photos, and /albums APIs located at http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com

1. The application should display a list of users
2. Selecting a user should display a list of photo albums for that user
3. The list of albums should show a thumbnail of the album, which is just the first photo's thumbnail.
4. Clicking on an album should show the entire list of photos in the album, using each photo's thumbnail.
5. Clicking on a photo should show the full size photo with the photo's title as a caption.
6. The application should support asynchronous pagination of albums and photos.
